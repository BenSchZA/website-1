## TokenEngineering Academy

The TokenEngineering Academy offers lectures, workshops, and seminars for everyone interested in this emerging field and putting it into practice.
We welcome crypto teams who aim to establish a proper token engineering practice. Please get in touch if you'd like to bring your team to TE Academy or collaborate with our students: <angela@tokenengineering.net>.  

## Token System Deep Dive: Ocean Protocol

[Ocean Protocol V3](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v3-is-now-live-b47c0e73f52a) is life and we’ll take the opportunity to explore the Ocean token system in a dedicated study group.

We’ll analyse the various parts of the token system:
- Ecosystem value flows and sustainability loops
- Ocean data marketplace and data tokens
- Balancer data pool staking mechnisms
- Ocean’s token design and verification approach

We'll discuss 

- benefits and risks of the token mechanisms chosen
- alternative application cases 
- new research questions

We’ll work together over approximately 3 weeks, and will have online sessions with amazing guests
like Trent McConaghy, Ocean Protocol Founder

## Ecosystem Value Flows

This course picks up where "[Business Model Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas#cite_note-Osterwalder2010-3)" ends. The first phase in Token Model Generation consists of analyzing and specifying the value network of organizations and individuals to be tokenized. We'll start with canvases familiar to business and product architects, with adaptations to help us focus on value flows and motivations as inputs for incentive [mechanism design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design). We'll train to consciously take the macro and micro perspective, and will apply various methods for value flow visualization and specification. Finally, the value network description will be carried out in [Stocks & Flows](https://systemic2016.wordpress.com/system-dynamics-stock-and-flow-modelling/) diagrams.  
The course has the following structure:  
Part 1: Ecosystem Purpose & Members  
Part 2: Stakeholder Interactions & Motives  
Part 3: Games & Governance  
Part 4: Value Network Specification (adapted Stock & Flow)  
With this output, you will be ready for the next phases of the Token Model Generation: applying existing cryptoeconomic patterns, adaptations, and new mechanisms. You or your technical counterpart can then specify the dynamic model further using [Differential Specification Syntax](https://community.cadcad.org/t/differential-specification-syntax-key/31) and simulate using [cadCAD](https://cadcad.org/). If you are not familiar with systems modeling and systems dynamics, this course is a prerequisite.

## TokenEngineering Academy

The TokenEngineering Academy offers lectures, workshops, and seminars for everyone interested in this emerging field and putting it into practice.
We welcome crypto teams who aim to establish a proper token engineering practice. Please get in touch if you'd like to bring your team to TE Academy or collaborate with our students: <angela@tokenengineering.net>.

## Introduction to Token Engineering

This two hours session provides an introduction to Token Engieering. It covers the following topics:
- Engineering Ethics
- Foundations of the discipline
- Design goals and steps in the Token Engineering Process
- Practical application
- Becoming a token engineer
- Token Engineering community overview

**Date:** September 2020, dates tba
**Location:** online/live  
**Fee:** free  
**Number of participants:** up to 20  


## Ecosystem Value Flows

This interactive online course picks up where "[Business Model Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas#cite_note-Osterwalder2010-3)" ends. The first phase in Token Model Generation consists of analyzing and specifying the value network of organizations and individuals to be tokenized. We start with [canvases](https://github.com/villeeloranta/ecosystem-design-toolkit) that are familiar to business and product architects, with adaptations to help us focus on motivations in order to analyze value flows and as inputs for incentive [mechanism design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design). The description of the value network is then carried out in a visual language similar to [stock & flows](https://systemic2016.wordpress.com/system-dynamics-stock-and-flow-modelling/). The course has the following structure:

- Day 1: Ecosystem Purpose & Members
- Day 2: Stakeholder Stories & Motives
- Day 3: Value Flows & Constraints
- Day 4: Value Network Specification

With this output, you will be ready for the next phases of Token Model Generation: applying existing cryptoeconomic patterns, adaptations, and new mechanisms. You or your technical counterpart can then specify the dynamic model further using [Differential Specification Syntax](https://community.cadcad.org/t/differential-specification-syntax-key/31) and simulate using [cadCAD](https://cadcad.org/). If you are not familiar with systems modeling and systems dynamics, this course is a prerequisite.
